This backend is built with Spring Boot, providing a robust RESTful API to manage laptop products, user authentication, and enquiries. It handles data persistence using a relational database (such as MySQL), enabling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on laptops and user data.

Key features include:

Secure user login and registration with role-based access (admin and users).

Laptop management APIs for adding, updating, deleting, and fetching laptop details.

Enquiry form handling and storage for user requests.

Image upload and retrieval support for product images.

Integration with the frontend through JSON APIs.

This backend ensures a scalable and secure foundation for the laptop showcase website.
